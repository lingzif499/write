1、在任意可访问互联网、可开启移动热点的计算机中编辑系统hosts文件，使任意设备在连接至计算机并请求特定域名时解析到计算机本地或其他域名

以Windows系统为例：（hosts文件位于C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc下）

# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost

#在此处写下需要本机ip地址（即需要转发至的地址）与触发转发条件的请求域名
#以下一行意为：当连接到此计算机热点的设备请求www.example.com时都会被解析至192.168.31.22:80

192.168.31.22 www.example.com

# To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal
# End of section
